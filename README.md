# [Build a REST API With Laravel][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


REST APIs are useful for all kinds of apps. They can be the back-end to a front-end web app, they can store data for a mobile app, or they can provide services to other apps or APIs. There are a lot of moving pieces to coding a RESTful API, but having the right tools can make it a lot easier. Laravel is one such toolâ€”a great platform for building REST APIs.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will teach you how to write a RESTful API using Laravel. Follow along as Jeremy codes a complete API that serves data on flights, airports and airline customers. Along the way, you'll learn how to define and seed a database, accept and validate input, and protecting the API.
